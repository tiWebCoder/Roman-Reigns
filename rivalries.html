									The rivalry between Roman Reigns &amp; Brock Lesnar dates to 2015 on the road to Wrestlemania 31. Reigns winning 
									the Royal Rumble match earned his opportunity to challenge for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship versus Brock 
									Lesnar who retained the championship that same night. Building towards this match, Reigns looked to show critics that 
									he can beat Lesnar. Throughout their Wrestlemania match, Lesnar dominated for most part before Reigns made a comeback. 
									Unfortunately, neither men walked out Wrestlemania victorious as Seth Rollins used his Money in The Bank contract to 
									enter this championship match and win the title. 3 years later, Reigns &amp; Lesnar faced off again in the main event 
									of Wrestlemania this time for the Universal Championship. They&apos;re clash went back and forth but ultimately, it 
									would be Lesnar who emerged victorious. The summer that same year, both men faced off at Summerslam &amp; it would be 
									Reigns standing tall as champion.
